            <p>
             
              <b>Git</b> is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of 
              computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are 
              collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include 
              speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of 
              parallel branches running on different computers).Git was originally authored by Linus 
              Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers 
              contributing to its initial development.Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core 
              maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most 
              clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged 
              repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent 
              of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software shared 
              under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="_blank" > GPL-2.0-only license.</a> </p>

            <p>Git provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features,
              issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection 
              of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace.</p><br>

              <h4>developers need Git</h2>
              <p> Developers use Git to collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain a history 
                of their work, enabling easy debugging and teamwork.</p> <br>

            <h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
            <p> A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows developers to work 
              on features or fixes independently from the main codebase. The branch and its code 
              can represent a new feature, a bug fix, or perhaps a new release candidate (RC) of 
              an existing product.</p>
